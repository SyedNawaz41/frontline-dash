            What does affirmative action mean?
            </strong>
            <p class="lg">Affirmative action is best understood in terms of the goal: equal employment opportunity for everyone. Equal Employment Opportunity is the condition where all personnel decisions such as hiring, promotions, etc., are made without any consideration of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender preference, physical or mental disability, medical condition, ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or status as a covered veteran. Affirmative action, therefore, is a vehicle by which we seek to reach the goal of equal employment opportunity. Affirmative Action may take the form of outreach recruitment efforts, educational opportunities for career advancement, and other training and skill enhancement programs for all employees, including women, minorities, persons with disabilities and covered veterans.</p>

            What is an affirmative action program?
            </strong>
            <p class="lg">An affirmative action program is a tool designed to ensure equal employment opportunity. It includes those policies, practices and procedures that Aya Healthcare, Inc will implement to ensure that all qualified applicants and employees are receiving an equal opportunity for recruitment, selection, advancement, training, development and every other term, condition and privilege of employment.</p>

            Why are you being asked to complete this form?

            <p class="lg rgb">Because we do business with the government, we must reach out to, hire, and provide equal opportunity to qualified people with disabilities* i To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.</p>
            <p class="lg rgb">If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.</p>
